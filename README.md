# PISA2012
PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.
Around 510,000 students in 65 nations participated in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, math, science accounting for 28 million 15 year olds worldwide. Of those, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.
