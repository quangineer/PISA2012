# PISA2012
PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school. Around 510,000 students in 65 nations participated in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, math, science accounting for 28 million 15 year olds worldwide. Of those, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.

After analyzing dataset, I come up with some insightful conclusions:
1. The support of parents is very important to the development of a child. The research shows us that children whose at least one of their parents staying at home to take care them will perform much better compared to those whose parents have to go out and work. 
2. In general, female students performs better than male students in reading subject. On the other hand, male students are better at math than female students. They both do very well at science subjects.
3. The originality of family member does not have any correlation to the scores that their children perform at school. However, the more diverse the family is (in term of country of originality of family members), the better their male children perform (compared to family where children and their parents were born in the same country).
4. Asian students perform better compared to the rest of the world in overall performance.
